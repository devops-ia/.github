## Steps for cleaning up commit history with `git rebase`

This process uses an interactive rebase to clean up your commit history by combining, editing, or removing commits, followed by a force push to update the remote repository with the cleaned history. Be cautious when using git push --force as it overwrites the commit history on the remote branch.

1. Clone repository
2. Start an Interactive Rebase
    Begin an interactive rebase for the last 10 commits (or adjust the number as needed):

    ```bash
    git rebase -i HEAD~1
    ```

3. Edit commits in the editor
    The editor will open with a list of commits. Use the following commands to clean up the commits:
      * `pick`: Keep the commit as is.
      * `reword`: Change the commit message.
      * `edit`: Amend the commit.
      * `squash`: Combine this commit with the previous one.
      * `fixup`: Like squash, but discard this commit’s message.
      * `drop`: Remove the commit.
    Example to squash and reword:

    ```bash
    pick e1c2f34 Commit message 1
    squash d2c3e45 Commit message 2
    reword f3d4e56 Commit message 3
    ```

4. Save and Close the Editor
    After making your changes, save and close the editor. Git will apply the changes.

5. Resolve Any Conflicts
    If there are conflicts, Git will pause and prompt you to resolve them:

    ```bash
    # Edit the files to resolve conflicts
    git add <resolved_files>
    git rebase --continue
    ```

    Repeat until the rebase completes.

6. Force Push the Cleaned History
    Finally, force push the changes to the remote repository:

    ```bash
    git push origin main --force
    ```
